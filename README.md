# 📜 Historical Events Web Page

This project was created as part of my studies at Ironhack. The primary focus was on implementing key functionalities, while visual design was not a priority. Despite its minimalist design, the application boasts several robust features that showcase strong technical skills.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Historical Events Web Page** is a web application where users can explore and contribute to a rich database of historical events. Below are the core features:

### 🔐 User Registration and Authentication

- Users can sign up and create an account on the platform.
- Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt** to ensure user data is protected.
- Once logged in, users can add and manage historical events.

### 🕰️ Adding Historical Events

- Authenticated users can add new historical events to the database.
- Each event includes detailed information such as the date, description, and other relevant details.

### 💬 Comment System

- Users can leave comments on historical events.
- Comments are stored in the database and displayed along with the username of the commenter.

### ⭐ Rating System

- Users can rate historical events.
- The application displays both the total number of ratings and the average rating for each event.

### 🛠️ CRUD Operations

- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for managing historical events.

### 🔍 Search Functionality

- Users can search for historical events by keywords, making it easier to navigate and find specific entries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Handlebars (HBS) for dynamic HTML content generation.
- **Backend**: Express.js as the server framework.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing event data.
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Other Tools**: Node.js, Mongoose for database modeling.
